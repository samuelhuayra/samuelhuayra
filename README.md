I consider myself as a person who believes and needs God and who also loves his family very much.
Throughout my professional career I’ve learned many thing and met many incredible people, thanks to them I‘ve became in the person that I am now.
However I’m aware that we can always improve, that’s why I try to make new things and grow every single day to gain the respect from my team and my superiors, so I could get to be a person who the people would like to follow.
I firmly believe that every effort someday comes to have its reward. 
My goals are well defined, and I try to keep myself focused on them. 🍃
